## Editing history
#1/29/2025 - Change from TN regions (1 or 2) to assignments by MSA.Use 2024 MSA designations to match the MSA designations listed in the market rate survey. 
#1/17/2025 - Add validater reminders, change SSS_year in filepath
#1/16/2025 - Edits made to filepaths for movement to the new directory made by SBr.
