Child care scripts by state

This repo includes the various child care scripts for a state. 
Beginning scripts were crafted for the 2025 SSS year.

Contents: These scripts include code for cleaning up the data and performing calculations. 
Goal: perform data preparation using Python code, with calculations via R. 

Next steps: 
- Develop an ideal standard format(s) for the processed data.
- Develop the calculations code for the various formats.
This will make the calculations more standardized, and be quicker to validate.
